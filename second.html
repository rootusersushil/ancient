                Ancient Greeks gave the name Scythia (or Great Scythia) to all the lands north-east of Europe and the
                northern coast
                of the Black Sea. According to Oxford University author's Samuel Arrowsmith, B Fellowes and Luke Graves
                Hansard in
                their 1832 book A Grammar of Ancient Geography, Scythia had two parts, Scythia Intra Imaum and Scythia
                Extra Imaum
                both covering a combined area of 1,129,000 mi2 or 2,924,096 km2. The Scythians – the Greeks' name for
                this
                nomadic people –inhabited Scythia from at least the 11th century BC to the 2nd century AD.Its location
                and
                extent varied over time but usually extended farther to the west than is indicated on the map opposite.

                The Sarmatians (Latin: Sarmatæ or Sauromatæ, Greek: Σαρμάται, Σαυρομάται) were an Iranian people during
                classical
                antiquity, flourishing from about the 5th century BC to the 4th century AD. They spoke Scythian, an
                Indo-European language from the Eastern Iranian family.Originating in Central Asia, the Sarmatians
                started their
                westward migration around the 6th century bc, coming to dominate the closely related Scythians by the
                2nd century bc.
                The Sarmatians differed from the Scythians in their veneration of the god of fire rather than god of
                nature,
                and their women's prominent role in warfare, which possibly served as the inspiration for the Amazons.
                At their greatest reported extent, around 1st century AD, these tribes ranged from the Vistula River to
                the
                mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas as
                well as
                the Caucasus to the south.Their territory, which was known as Sarmatia to Greco-Roman ethnographers,
                corresponded to the western part of greater Scythia (mostly modern Ukraine and Southern Russia, also to
                a
                smaller extent north eastern Balkans around Moldova). According to authors Arrowsmith, Fellowes and
                Graves
                Hansard in their book A Grammar of Ancient Geography published in 1832, Sarmatia had two parts, Sarmatia
                Europea
                and Sarmatia Asiatica covering a combined area of 503,000 sq mi or 1,302,764 km2.

                Xiongnu (Hsiung nu) was a nomadic empire that flourished in the central Asia. Their origin is debatable,
                but they
                probably spoke either an Iranian, Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, or Yeniseian language. They conquered
                most of
                modern Mongolia under their leader Toumen (220–209 BC) in the 3rd century BC. During Modu's reign
                (209–174 BC)
                they defeated both the Donghu in the east and Yuezhi in the west and they began threatening Han China.
                The Great Wall of China had been constructed to protect Chinese towns from the Xiongnu attacks. While
                the Chinese
                were trying to bring the Xiongnu under control, something of high significance happened: cross-cultural
                encounters.
                A large variety of people (such as traders, ambassadors, hostages, parents in cross-cultural marriages,
                etc.)
                served as helpers that passed on ideas, values, and techniques across cultural boundary lines. These
                encounters
                helped cultures learn from other cultures. The Xiongnu Empire disintegrated into two parts during the
                1st century;
                eventually the Xiongnu fell due to their defeat in the Han–Xiongnu War.

                Huns were nomadic people who were known for their hordes of mounted archers. Their language seems to be
                Turkic;
                but Mongolic, Yeniseian, Uralic etc., are also postulated. After 370 under a certain Balamber they
                founded an empire
                in the East Europe defeating Alans and Goths. They triggered the great migration which eventually caused
                the collapse
                of the West Roman Empire. The death of Rugila in 434 left the sons of his brother Mundzuk, Attila and
                Bleda, in
                control of the united Hun tribes. Attila the Hun ruled of the Huns from 434 until his death in 453.
                Under his rule
                and leader of the Hunnic Empire, the empire stretched from Germany to the Ural River and from the Danube
                River to
                the Baltic Sea. Hunnic khagan Atilla invaded Europe. The rise of the Huns around 370 overwhelmed the
                Gothic kingdoms.
                Many of the Goths migrated into Roman territory in the Balkans, while others remained north of the
                Danube under Hunnic rule.
                During Attila the Hun's rule, he was one of the most fearsome enemies of the Western and Eastern Roman
                Empire. He
                invaded the Balkans twice and marched through Gaul (modern France) as far as Orléans before being
                defeated at the
                Battle of Châlons. Although his invasion of Gaul was checked at Chalons, he appeared in North Italy in
                the next year.
                After Atilla's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed.the Huns seem to have been absorbed by other
                ethnic groups
                such as the Bulgars.Kim, however, argues that the Huns continued under Ernak, becoming the Kutrigur
                and Utigur
                Hunno-Bulgars.This conclusion is still subject to some controversy. Some scholars also argue that
                another group
                identified in ancient sources as Huns, the North Caucasian Huns, were genuine Huns.The rulers
                of various
                post-Hunnic steppe peoples are known to have claimed descent from Attila in order to legitimize their
                right to the power,
                and various steppe peoples were also called "Huns" by Western and Byzantine sources from the fourth
                century onward.

            The Archaic or Early Dynastic Period of Egypt is the era immediately following the unification of Upper and
            Lower Egypt c.
            3100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the end of the Naqada
            III
            archaeological period until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom.With the First Dynasty,
            the
            capital moved from Thinis to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the
            major
            holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many
            aspects of
            religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. During the Early Dynastic period, the pharaohs
            established the
            earliest Central Government in the world.

            The Old Kingdom is the period spanning c. 2686–2181 BC. It is also known as the "Age of the Pyramids" or the
            "Age of the
            Pyramid Builders", as it encompasses the reigns of the great pyramid builders of the Fourth Dynasty—King
            Sneferu perfected
            the art of pyramid-building and the pyramids of Giza were constructed under the kings Khufu, Khafre and
            Menkaure. Egypt
            attained its first sustained peak of civilization—the first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods (followed
            by the Middle
            Kingdom and New Kingdom) which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley.
            During the Old Kingdom, the pyramid building in ancient Egypt began during the Third Dynasty under the rule
            of king Djoser
            when he built the Step Pyramid of Djoser (Egypt's first Pyramid) and peaked during Fourth Dyansty during the
            construction
            of the Giza Pyramids.During the Fifth Dynasty the pyramid building declined in Egypt. The Pyramid Texts, the
            oldest
            ritual texts from ancient Egypt first appeared in the late fifth Dynasty.

            The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (also known as "The Period of Reunification") is the period in the history of
            ancient Egypt
            following a period of political division known as the First Intermediate Period. The Middle Kingdom lasted
            from around
            2050 BC to around 1710 BC, stretching from the reunification of Egypt under the reign of Mentuhotep II of
            the Eleventh
            Dynasty to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty. The Eleventh Dynasty ruled from Thebes and the Twelfth Dynasty
            ruled from
            el-Lisht.The middle kingdom reached its peak under the pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhat III. Senusret III
            was a
            great pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty and is considered to be the greatest pharaoh in the middle kingdom.
            However,
            The reign of Amenemhat III was the height of Middle Kingdom economic prosperity. His reign is remarkable for
            the
            degree to which Egypt exploited its resources.

            The New Kingdom began around 1550 B.C when king Ahmose I became the king of Egypt, defeated the Hyksos and
            reunified
            Egypt. The pharaohs of the new kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their
            borders and
            strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbors. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his
            grandson
            Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Tuthmosis
            III is
            recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates
            to Nubia
            during seventeen known military campaigns. During the reign of Amenhotep III, Egypt entered a period of
            unprecedented
            prosperity and artistic splendour, Egypt reached the peak of its artistic and international power in his
            reign.
            Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name
            to Akhenaten,
            touted the god Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of other deities, and attacked the power of
            the priestly
            establishment. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten, he turned a deaf ear to foreign affairs and
            absorbed
            himself in his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the religion of the Aten was quickly
            abandoned, and
            the subsequent pharaohs erased all mention of Akhenaten's Egyptian heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.
            Ramesses the Great ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks,
            and
            sire more children than any other pharaoh in history. One of the greatest construction projects conducted by
            Ramesses
            was the city of Pi-Ramesses. The city covered an area of 18 km2 (as big as Rome). At its peak, The city was
            home to a
            population of 160,000-300,000. This would make Pi-Ramesses 2-4 times bigger than Yinxu (Second largest city
            at that time).
            Ramesses led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh and, after fighting to a stalemate,
            finally agreed to
            the first recorded peace treaty. Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion,
            particularly by the
            Libyans and the Sea Peoples. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions during the reign of
            Ramesses III,
            but Egypt eventually lost control of Syria and Palestine. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by
            internal problems
            such as corruption, tomb robbery and civil unrest. The high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes
            accumulated vast tracts
            of land and wealth, and their growing power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.

            The Third Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt began with the death of Pharaoh Ramesses XI in 1070 BC,
            ending the
            New Kingdom, and was eventually followed by the Late Period. Various points are offered as the beginning for
            the
            latter era, though it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty by
            Psamtik I
            in 664 BC.The first Dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian Third Intermediate Period is the Twenty-first Dynasty.
            Its first
            ruler is king Smendes who ruled only in Lower Egypt. The most powerful pharaohs of the Twenty-first dynasty
            were
            psusennes I and Siamun who built extensively compared to the other pharaohs of the dynasty. The Pharaohs of
            the
            Twenty-first Dynasty transported all the old Ramesside temples, obelisks, stelae, statues and sphinxes from
            Pi-Ramesses
            to the new capital Tanis. The obelisks and statues, the largest weighing over 200 tons, were transported in
            one piece
            while major buildings were dismantled into sections and reassembled at Tanis.
            The country was firmly reunited by the Twenty-Second Dynasty founded by Shoshenq I in 945 BC (or 943 BC),
            who descended
            from Meshwesh immigrants, originally from Ancient Libya. Upon unifying Egypt, king Shoshenq I started
            campaigning in the Levante . This brought stability to the country for well over a century and made Egypt a
            superpower again, but after the reign of Osorkon II, particularly, the country had effectively split into
            two states, with Shoshenq III of the Twenty-Second Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while Takelot
            II and his son Osorkon (the future Osorkon III) ruled Middle and Upper Egypt.

            The Late Period of ancient Egypt refers to the last flowering of native Egyptian rulers after the Third
            Intermediate Period beginning with the 26th Saite Dynasty founded by Psamtik I. The 26th Dynasty of Egypt
            managed to regain Egypt's power for a short time before the Achaemenid Persian conquest of Egypt lead by
            Cambyses II in 525 BC.

            However, the Egyptians managed to gain independence from the Persians during a rebellion led by the rebel
            Pharaoh Amyrtaeus around 404 B.C who established the Twenty-eighth Dynasty of Egypt. Egypt remained
            independent during the Twenty-ninth Dynasty and Thirtieth Dynasty until the Persians invaded it again in 343
            B.C. During that time, the Egyptians managed to repel several attacks from the Achaemenid Empire. The most
            famous attack of them occurred in around 351 BC, when Artaxerxes III embarked on a campaign to recover
            Egypt, which had revolted under his father, Artaxerxes II. Levying a vast army, Artaxerxes marched into
            Egypt, and engaged Nectanebo II the founder of the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt. After a year of fighting the
            Egyptian Pharaoh, Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led
            by the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius.

            The Late period of ancient Egypt ends when Alexander the Great took Egypt from the Persians without war
            around 332 B.C.

            The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques
            that facilitated the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a
            practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the
            first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known
            peace treaty. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities
            carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers
            and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period
            led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural
            legacy, for Egypt and the world.

            The Kerma culture was an early civilization which flourished from around 2500 BC to about 1600 BC in Nubia,
            present day Sudan, centered at Kerma. It seems to have been one of a number of Sudanese states during the
            Middle Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt. In its latest phase, lasting from about 1700–1500 BC, it absorbed
            the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt. Around 1500 BC, it was
            absorbed into the Egyptian Empire, but rebellions continued for centuries. By the 11th century BC, the more
            'Egyptianized' Kingdom of Kush emerged, apparently from Kerma, and regained the region's independence from
            Egypt.

            The Kingdom of Kush was the earliest of the Subsaharan states in Africa as well as the first to implement
            iron weapons. It was heavily influenced by Egyptian colonists, but in 1070 BC it became not only independent
            of Egypt but a fierce rival. It successfully fought off attempts by Egypt to reconquer it, and it began to
            extend influence over Upper Egypt. By the end of King Kashta's reign in 752 BC, Thebes was under Kushite
            control. A slew of able successors took the rest of Egypt and reigned as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt
            stretching Kushite control from central Sudan to modern-day Israel. The Kushites did not maintain this
            empire for long
            and were beaten back by the Assyrians in 653 BC. However, Kush remained a powerful entity in the region. It
            continued to meddle in Egyptian affairs and control trade resources originating in Subsaharan Africa. It
            waged a hard-fought campaign against the Roman Empire (27 BC - 22 BC) under the leadership of Queen
            Amanirenas, and achieved a more than amicable peace with the young Augustus Caesar. The two states worked as
            allies, with Kush lending cavalry support to Rome in its conquest of Jerusalem in 70 AD.
            The kingdom of Kush maintained its status as a regional power until its conquest by the Aksumite Empire in
            350.

            The Macrobians were an ancient people and kingdom situated in the Horn of Africa (Somalia) around the 1st
            millennium BC. According to Herodotus, the Macrobians practiced an elaborate form of embalming. This, in
            turn, suggested a knowledge on their part of anatomy and, at the very least, a grasp of the basics of
            chemistry. The Macrobians preserved the bodies of the dead by first extracting moisture from the corpses,
            then overlaying the bodies with a type of plaster, and finally decorating the exterior in vivid colors in
            order to imitate the deceased as realistically as possible. They then placed the body in a hollow crystal
            pillar, which they kept in their homes for a period of about a year.[19] Macrobia was also noted for its
            gold, which was so plentiful that the Macrobians shackled their prisoners in golden chains.
            The Ancient city-states located in northern Somalia, had a steady trade link with the Ancient Egyptians and
            exported precious natural resources such as myrrh, frankincense and gum. This trade network continued all
            the way into the classical era. The city states of Mossylon, Malao, Mundus and Tabae in Somalia engaged in a
            lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemaic Egypt, Greece, Parthian
            Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as
            the 'beden' to transport their cargo.

            The Kingdom of Aksum was an important trading nation originating from Northern Ethiopia in northeastern
            Africa, growing from the proto-Aksumite period ca. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century
            AD. It was a major player in the commerce between the Roman Empire and Ancient India and the Aksumite rulers
            facilitated trade by minting their own currency. The state established its hegemony over the declining
            Kingdom of Kush and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian peninsula, and would
            eventually extend its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. At its peak it
            controlled Much of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It was
            considered by historians as one of the most powerful military powers in the world.

                Sumer (or Šumer) was one of the early civilizations of the Ancient Near East, located in the southern part of 
                Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) from the time of the earliest records in the mid 4th millennium BC until the rise of 
                Babylonia in the late 3rd millennium BC.The term "Sumerian" applies to all speakers of the Sumerian language. 
                Sumer (together with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilization) is considered the first settled society in the 
                world to have manifested all the features needed to qualify fully as a "civilization", eventually expanding into the 
                first empire in history, the Akkadian Empire.

                The Hurrians refer to a people who inhabited northern Mesopotamia beginning approximately 2500 BC. The Hurrian 
                kingdoms of the Ancient Near East was in Northern Mesopotamia and its people lived in the adjacent regions during 
                the Bronze Age. The largest and most influential Hurrian nation was the kingdom of Mitanni. The population of the 
                Hittite Empire in Anatolia to a large part consisted of Hurrians, and there is significant Hurrian influence in 
                Hittite mythology. By the Early Iron Age, the Hurrians had been assimilated with other peoples, except perhaps in 
                the kingdom of Urartu. The Hurrian peoples were not incredibly united, existing as quasi-feudal kingdoms. 
                The kingdom of Mitanni was at its height towards the close of the 14th century BC. By the 13th century BC, 
                the Hurrian kingdoms had been conquered by foreign powers, chiefly the Assyrians.

                In the earliest historical times, the term Assyria referred to a region on the Upper Tigris river, named for its 
                original capital, the ancient city of Assur. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the Fertile 
                Crescent, Egypt and much of Anatolia, the term "Assyria proper" referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia 
                (the southern half being Babylonia), with Nineveh as its capital. The Assyrian homeland was located near a 
                mountainous region, extending along the Tigris as far as the high Gordiaean or Carduchian mountain range of Armenia, 
                sometimes known as the "Mountains of Ashur". The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in 
                history. These are called the Old, Middle, and Neo-Assyrian kingdoms, or periods. The most powerful and best-known 
                nation of these periods is the Neo-Assyrian Empire, 934–609 BC. Shalmaneser III (858–823 BC) attacked and reduced 
                Babylonia to vassalage, and defeated Aramea, Israel, Urartu, Phoenicia and the neo Hittite states, forcing all of 
                these to pay tribute to Assyria. Shamshi-Adad V (822–811 BC) inherited an empire beset by civil war which he took 
                most of his reign to quell. He was succeeded by Adad-nirari III who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by 
                the famed queen Semiramis until 806 BC. In that year Adad-nirari III took the reins of power. After his premature 
                death, Assyria failed to expand further during the reigns of Shalmaneser IV (782–773 BC), Ashur-dan III (772–755 BC) 
                and Ashur-nirari V (754–746 BC). Under Ashurbanipal (669–627 BC) its domination spanned from the Caucasus Mountains 
                in the north to Nubia, Egypt and Arabia in the south, and from Cyprus and Antioch in the west to Persia in the east. 
                Ashurbanipal destroyed Elam and smashed a rebellion led by his own brother Shamash-shum-ukim who was the Assyrian 
                king of Babylon, exacting savage revenge on the Chaldeans, Nabateans, Arabs and Elamites who had supported him. 
                Persia and Media were regarded as vassals of Ashurbanipal. He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the 
                building of temples and palaces.

                The profound political, social, and cultural influence imposed upon the Near East by the civilization known as the 
                Ancient Babylonian Empire was the most pervasive in this historical period. The city itself, Babylon, positioned 
                itself as a center of pivotal historical developments for centuries. There were 3 major Babylonian Dynasties: 
                Amorite, Kassite, and Chaldean. This political entity was most predominate within the southern portion of Mesopotamia.
                 It existed as an unremitting rival of the northern Assyrian Mesopotamians. Although it was assaulted and militarily 
                 overcome on several occasions, it did exist as a stalwart presence from the later 3rd millennium BC to the middle of 
                 the 6th century BC. After the fall of the Assyrian Empire in 612 BC, the Babylonian Empire was the most powerful 
                 state in the ancient world. Its capital, Babylon, was beautifully adorned by King Nebuchadnezzar, who erected 
                 several famous buildings. Even after the Babylonian Empire had been overthrown by the Persian king Cyrus the 
                 Great in 539 BC, the city itself remained an important cultural center. This period would be considered the 
                 zenith of Babylon's dominance in its two-and-a-half millennium history. Ancient Babylon was officially conquered 
                 by the Achaemenid Persian Empire in the late 6th century BC.

                Phoenicia was a major power over the Mediterranean between 1200 BC and 539 BC.This ancient Semitic 
                thalassocratic civilization was situated on the western, coastal part of the Fertile Crescent and centered on the 
                coastline of modern Lebanon. All major Phoenician cities were on the coastline of the Mediterranean, some colonies 
                reaching the Western Mediterranean. It was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the 
                Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC. The Phoenicians used the galley, a man-powered sailing vessel, and are 
                credited with the invention of the bireme.They were famed in Classical Greece and Rome as 'traders in purple', 
                referring to their monopoly on the precious purple dye of the Murex snail, used, among other things, for royal 
                clothing, and for the spread of their alphabets, from which almost all modern phonetic alphabets are derived.

                The Carthaginian Empire, also known as the Carthaginian Republic (alternatively "Carthaginian hegemony", or simply "Carthage") 
                was the Phoenician city-state of Carthage and its sphere of influence, which included much of the coast of North Africa as well 
                as substantial parts of coastal Iberia and the islands of the western Mediterranean from 814 to 146 BC.

                The Hittites were an ancient people who spoke an Indo-European language, and established a kingdom centered at 
                Hattusa in north-central Anatolia from the 18th century BC. In the 14th century BC, the Hittite Empire was at 
                its height, encompassing central Anatolia, northwestern Syria as far as Ugarit, and upper Mesopotamia. 
                After 1180 BC, the empire disintegrated into several independent "Neo-Hittite" city-states, some surviving until as 
                late as the 8th century BC.

                Elam was situated just to the east of Mesopotamia and was one of the oldest recorded civilizations. Elam was 
                centered in the far west and southwest of modern-day Iran, stretching from the lowlands of Khuzestan and Ilam 
                Province (which takes its name from Elam), as well as a small part of southern Iraq. In the Old Elamite period 
                (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd 
                millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands.
                Elam was part of the early cities of the Ancient Near East during the Chalcolithic (Copper Age). 
                The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Mesopotamian history where writing was used 
                slightly earlier. Elamite strength was based on an ability to hold various areas together under a coordinated 
                government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally, 
                this was done through a federated governmental structure.Elamite culture played a crucial role in the Persian Empire, 
                especially during the Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it, when the Elamite language remained among those in official 
                use. The Elamite language is generally treated as a language isolate. As such, the Elamite period is considered a 
                starting point for the history of Iran.

                The Median Empire was the first empire on the territory of Persia. By the 6th century BC, after having together with 
                the Babylonians defeated the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In Greek references to "Median" people there is no clear 
                distinction between the "Persians" and the "Medians"; in fact for a Greek to become "too closely associated with 
                Iranian culture" was "to become medianized, not persianized". The Median kingdom was a short-lived Iranian state 
                and the textual and archaeological sources of that period are rare and little could be known from the Median culture 
                which nevertheless made a "profound, and lasting, contribution to the greater world of Iranian culture". The Medes 
                were able to establish their own empire, the largest of its day, lasting for about sixty years, from the sack of 
                Nineveh in 612 BC until 549 BC when Cyrus the Great established the Achaemenid Empire by defeating his overlord and 
                grandfather, Astyages, king of Media.

                The Achaemenid Empire was the first of the Persian Empires to become a world empire. At the height of its power, 
                the Empire spanned over three continents, namely Europe, Asia, and Africa, and was the most powerful empire of its 
                time. It also eventually, either quickly in its earliest days or steadily over time, incorporated the following 
                territories: in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), parts of the Balkan peninsula - Thrace, 
                Macedon and Paeonia, and most of the Black Sea coastal regions or present day southern and eastern Bulgaria, 
                northern Greece, and Macedonia; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi Arabia, 
                Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions 
                of Libya; in the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia, and parts of Pakistan.
                Encompassing approximately 5.5 million square kilometers at its height in 500 BC,the Achaemenid Empire was 
                territorially the largest empire of antiquity.[dubious – discuss] In its time it had political power over 
                neighboring countries, and had high cultural and economic achievements during its lengthy rule over a vast region 
                from its picturesque capital at Persepolis.Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon) defeated the Persian 
                armies at Granicus (334 BC), followed by Issus (333 BC), and lastly at Gaugamela (331 BC). Afterwards, he marched 
                on Susa and Persepolis which surrendered in early 330 BC. From Persepolis, Alexander headed north to Pasargadae 
                where he visited the tomb of Cyrus the Great.

                Mesopotamia and Armenia. But unlike most other Iranian monarchies, the Parthian followed a vassal system, which they 
                The Parthian Empire was the third Iranian Empire. At the height of its power, the empire ruled most of Greater Iran, 
                adopted from the Seleucids. The Arsacid culture was not a single coherent state, but instead made up of numerous tributary 
                (but otherwise independent) kingdoms. The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and 
                royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed Persian, Hellenistic, and regional cultures. 
                For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually 
                saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions. The Arsacid rulers were titled the 'King of Kings', as a claim to be the 
                heirs to the Achaemenid Empire; indeed, they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have 
                had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, satraps. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, 
                largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. 
                With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from Nisa, Turkmenistan to Ctesiphon along 
                the Tigris (south of modern Baghdad, Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals. Although the 
                Parthian Arsacids made way for a new Iranian dynasty, the Arsacid family continued to exist through the 
                Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania; 
                all eponymous branches of the Parthian Arsacids.

                The Sasanian Empire is the name used for the fourth Iranian dynasty, and the second Persian Empire (226–651). 
                The empire's territory encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Afghanistan, eastern parts of Turkey, 
                and parts of Syria, Pakistan, and large parts of Caucasia, Central Asia and Arabia. During Khosrow II's rule in 
                590–628 Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon were also briefly annexed to the Empire, as well as far west as western 
                Asia Minor. The Sassanid era, encompassing the length of the Late Antiquity period, is considered to be one of the
                most important and influential historical periods in Iran. In many ways the Sassanid period witnessed the highest 
                achievement of Persian civilization. The empire is furthermore known for being the arch-rival of the neighboring 
                Roman–Byzantine Empire for a period of over 400 years. As the Parthians were replaced by the Sassanids, 
                they carried on the already century long lasting Roman–Persian Wars, which would eventually become the longest 
                conflict in human history.The empire constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the Muslim conquest and 
                adoption of Islam. The climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 had drastically exhausted both the Byzantines 
                as well as the Sassanids, laying the way open for an easy conquest. The Sassanids, heavily weakened, never mounted 
                a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the initial Arab armies. Ctesiphon fell after a prolonged 
                siege. Yazdegerd fled eastward from Ctesiphon, leaving behind him most of the Empire's vast treasury. 
                The Arabs captured Ctesiphon shortly afterward, leaving the Sassanid government strapped for funds and acquiring a 
                powerful financial resource for their own use. A number of Sassanid governors attempted to combine their forces to 
                throw back the invaders, but the effort was crippled by the lack of a strong central authority, and the governors 
                were defeated at the Battle of Nihawānd. The empire, with its military command structure non-existent, its non-noble 
                troop levies decimated, its financial resources effectively destroyed, and the Asawaran knightly caste destroyed 
                piecemeal, was utterly helpless in the face of the invaders. Upon hearing the defeat, Persian nobilities fled 
                further inland to the eastern province of Khorasan.
