                The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization (3300–1300 BC). Along with Mesopotamia
                and Pharaonic Egypt, it was a cradle of early civilization in the Old World (Childe 1950). Of the
                three, the Indus was the most expansive, covering an area of 1.25 million km2
                and encompassing what is today most of Pakistan, parts of Afghanistan, and north west India. It
                flourished in the basins of the Indus River, one of the major rivers of Asia, and the Ghaggar-Hakra
                River,
                which once coursed through northwest India and eastern Pakistan. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may
                have had a population of over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new
                techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and
                tin).
                The Indus cities are noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems,
                water
                supply systems, and clusters of large non-residential buildings.

                The Nanda Empire originated from Magadha in Ancient India during the 5th and 4th centuries BC. At its
                greatest
                extent, the Nandas ruled much of Northern India. The Nandas are sometimes described as the first empire
                builders in the recorded history of India. They inherited the large kingdom of Magadha. They built up a
                vast
                army.The Nandas never had the opportunity to see their army up against Alexander the Great, who invaded
                India
                at the time of Dhana Nanda, since Alexander had to confine his campaign to the plains of Punjab, for his
                forces
                at the prospect of facing a further mighty Magadha army, mutinied at the Hyphasis River (the modern Beas
                River)
                refusing to march any further. There had been confluence of Indian, Persian and Greek civilization in
                those period.
                Continuing the early Hindu Vedas and Upanishads texts, Nanda had an influence on Indian social, legal
                and political
                systems. In addition, the region of Gandhara, or present-day eastern Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan,
                became a
                mixture of various cultures, including Greek and Indian ones, and gave rise to a hybrid culture,
                Greco-Buddhism,
                which influenced the artistic development of Mahayana Buddhism.

                The Mauryan Empire was the first political entity to unite most of the Indian subcontinent and expand
                into Central
                Asia. Its cultural influence also extended west into Egypt and Syria, and east into Thailand, China and
                Burma.
                The Empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya. Chandragupta waged a war against the nearby
                Greek powers
                and won, forcing the Greeks to surrender large amounts of land. Under the reign of Ashoka the Great, the
                empire
                became pacifist and turned to spreading its soft power in the form of Buddhism.

                The Shunga Empire is a Magadha dynasty that controlled North-central and Eastern India as well as parts
                of the
                northwest (now Pakistan) from around 185 to 73 BC. It was established after the fall of the Indian
                Maurya Empire.
                The capital of the Shungas was Pataliputra. Later kings such as Bhagabhadra also held court at Vidisha,
                modern
                Besnagar in Eastern Malwa.The Shunga Empire is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and
                indigenous
                powers. While there is much debate on the religious politics of the Shunga dynasty, it is recognized for
                a
                number of contributions. Art, education, philosophy, and other learning flowered during this period.
                Most notably,
                Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and Mahabhasya were composed in this period, Panini composed the first Sanskrit
                grammarian
                Ashtadayai. It is also noted for its subsequent mention in the Malavikaagnimitra. This work was composed
                by
                Kalidasa in the later Gupta period, and romanticized the love of Malavika and King Agnimitra, with a
                background
                of court intrigue. Artistry on the subcontinent also progressed with the rise of the Mathura school,
                which is
                considered the indigenous counterpart to the more Hellenistic Gandhara school of Afghanistan and
                Pakistan.
                During the historical Shunga period (185 to 73 BC), Buddhist activity also managed to survive somewhat
                in
                central India (Madhya Pradesh) as suggested by some architectural expansions that were done at the
                stupas
                of Sanchi and Barhut, originally started under Emperor Ashoka. It remains uncertain whether these works
                were due to the weakness of the control of the Shungas in these areas, or a sign of tolerance on their
                part.The last of the Shunga emperor was Devabhuti (83–73 BC). He was assassinated by his minister
                (Vasudeva Kanva) and is said to have been overfond of the company of women. The Shunga dynasty was then
                replaced by the subsequent Kanvas.

                The Chola dynasty ruled parts of southern India. The Tamil dynasty which was one of the longest-ruling
                dynasties
                in southern India. The earliest datable references to this Tamil dynasty are in inscriptions from the
                3rd century
                BC left by Ashoka, of Maurya Empire; as one of the Three Crowned Kings, the dynasty continued to govern
                over
                varying territory until the 13th century AD. By the 9th century, under Rajaraja Chola and his son
                Rajendra Chola,
                the Cholas rose as a notable power in south Asia. The Chola Empire stretched as far as Bengal. At its
                peak,
                the empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km2 (1,400,000 sq mi).[citation needed] Rajaraja Chola conquered all
                of
                peninsular South India and parts of the Sri Lanka. Rajendra Chola's navies went even further, occupying
                coasts
                from Burma (now Myanmar) to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Sumatra, Java, Malaya
                in
                South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated Mahipala, the king of the Bengal, and to commemorate his
                victory
                he built a new capital and named it Gangaikonda Cholapuram.The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile
                valley of
                the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the heightof their power from the later
                half of the
                9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was
                united and
                held as one state for a period of two centuries and more. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendrala
                I, the
                dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-east Asia.The power of
                the
                new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the celebrated expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra
                Chola I
                undertook and by theoverthrow after an unprecedented naval war of the maritime empire of Srivijaya, as
                well as by
                the repeated embassies to China.During the period 1010-1200, the Chola territories stretched from the
                islands of
                the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh.Rajaraja
                Chola
                conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of what is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the
                Maldives.
                Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated
                the Pala
                ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. He also successfully invaded kingdoms of the Malay Archipelago.The Chola
                dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyas,who
                ultimately caused
                their downfall.The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in
                building
                temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture.The Chola kings were avid
                builders
                and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of
                economic activity.
                They pioneered a centralised form of government and established a disciplined bureaucracy.

                In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire unified much of India. This period is called the Golden
                Age of India
                and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic,
                literature, logic,
                mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally
                known as Hindu
                culture. Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II were the most notable rulers of the Gupta
                dynasty.
                The high points of this cultural creativity are magnificent architectures, sculptures and paintings. The
                Gupta
                period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma, and Vatsyayana who
                made great
                advancements in many academic fields. Science and political administration reached new heights during
                the Gupta era.
                Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural center and set the region up as a base that
                would
                influence nearby kingdoms and regions in Burma, Sri Lanka, Indonesian Archipelago and Indochina.

            The Shang dynasty (Chinese: 商朝; pinyin: Shāng cháo) or Yin dynasty (Chinese: 殷代; pinyin: Yīn dài), according to
            traditional historiography, ruled in the Yellow River valley in the second millennium BC, succeeding the Xia dynasty
            and followed by the Zhou dynasty. The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the Classic of History,
            Bamboo Annals and Records of the Grand Historian. According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations made
            approximately 2,000 years ago by Liu Xin, the Shang ruled from 1766 BC to 1122 BC, but according to the chronology
            based upon the "current text" of Bamboo Annals, they ruled from 1556 BC to 1046 BC. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology
            Project dated them from c. 1600 BC to 1046 BC. At its peak 1122 BC it covered an area of 1,250,000 km2.

            The Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC; Chinese: 周朝; pinyin: Zhōu Cháo; Wade–Giles: Chou1 Ch'ao2 [tʂóʊ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ]) was a
            Chinese dynasty that followed the Shang dynasty and preceded the Qin dynasty. Although the Zhou dynasty lasted
            longer than any other dynasty in Chinese history, the actual political and military control of China by the dynasty,
            surnamed Ji (Chinese: 姬), lasted only until 771 BC, a period known as the Western Zhou.
            This period of Chinese history produced what many consider the zenith of Chinese bronze-ware making. The dynasty also
            spans the period in which the written script evolved into its modern form with the use of an archaic clerical script 
            that emerged during the late Warring States period.

            The Qin dynasty was preceded by the feudal Zhou dynasty and followed by the Han dynasty in China. The unification of
            China in 221 BC under the First Emperor Qin Shi Huang marked the beginning of Imperial China, a period which lasted until
            the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.In 214 BC Qin Shihuang secured his boundaries to the north with a fraction 
            (100,000 men) of his large army, and sent the majority (500,000 men) south to seize still more land. Prior to the events
            leading to Qin dominance over China, they had gained possession of much of Sichuan to the southwest. The Qin army was 
            unfamiliar with the jungle terrain, and it was defeated by the southern tribes' guerrilla warfare tactics with over 
            100,000 men lost. However, in the defeat Qin was successful in building a canal to the south, which they used heavily 
            for supplying and reinforcing their troops during their second attack to the south. Building on these gains, the Qin
            armies conquered the coastal lands surrounding Guangzhou, and took the provinces of Fuzhou and Guilin. They struck as 
            far south as Hanoi. After these victories in the south, Qin Shihuang moved over 100,000 prisoners and exiles to colonize 
            the newly conquered area. In terms of extending the boundaries of his empire, the First Emperor was extremely successful 
            in the south.Despite its military strength, the Qin dynasty did not last long. When the first emperor died in 210 BC, 
            his son was placed on the throne by two of the previous emperor's advisers, in an attempt to influence and control the 
            administration of the entire country through him. The advisors squabbled among themselves, however, which resulted in 
            both their deaths and that of the second Qin emperor. Popular revolt broke out a few years later, and the weakened empire
            soon fell to a Chu lieutenant, who went on to found the Han dynasty. Despite its rapid end, the Qin dynasty influenced 
            future Chinese regimes, particularly the Han, and the European name for China is derived from it.

            The Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220), lasting 400 years, is commonly considered within China to be one of the greatest 
            periods in the history of China. At its height, the Han empire extended over a vast territory of 6 million km2 and 
            housed a population of approximately 55 million. During this time period, China became a military, economic, and 
            cultural powerhouse. The empire extended its political and cultural influence over Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, 
            and Central Asia before it finally collapsed under a combination of domestic and external pressures.
            The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government, known as commanderies, and a 
            number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly
            following the Rebellion of the Seven States. The Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation which dominated the eastern Eurasian
            Steppe, defeated the Han army in battle in 200 BC. Following the defeat, a political marriage alliance was negotiated
            in which the Han became the de facto inferior partner. When, despite the treaty, the Xiongnu continued to raid Han 
            borders, Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory 
            in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han s
            overeignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, 
            which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. Han forces managed to divide the Xiongnu into two competing nations, 
            the Southern and Northern Xiongnu, and forced the Northern Xiongnu across the Ili River. Despite these victories, the 
            territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. The Han Dynasty was 
            arguably one of the strongest's empires in the world during the reign of Emperor Wu, though was established as the 
            largest.

            The Jin dynasty (simplified Chinese: 晋朝; traditional Chinese: 晉朝; pinyin: Jìn Cháo; Wade–Giles: Chin⁴-ch'ao², 
            IPA: [tɕîn tʂʰɑ̌ʊ];), was a dynasty in Chinese history, lasting between the years 265 and 420 AD. There are two 
            main divisions in the history of the dynasty, the first being Western Jin (西晉, 265–316) and the second Eastern Jin 
            (東晉, 317–420). Western Jin was founded by Sima Yan, with its capital at Luoyang, while Eastern Jin was begun by 
            Sima Rui, with its capital at Jiankang. The two periods are also known as Liang Jin (兩晉; literally: two Jin) and 
            Sima Jin (司馬晉) by scholars, to distinguish this dynasty from other dynasties that use the same Chinese character,
            such as the Later Jin dynasty (後晉).

                Ancient Greece is the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the Archaic period
                of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. 
                At the center of this time period is Classical Greece, which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC,
                at first under Athenian leadership successfully repelling the military threat of Persian invasion.
                The Athenian Golden Age ends with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.
                Following the conquests of Alexander the Great, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the 
                western end of the Mediterranean Sea. Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, 
                which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe, for which reason Classical 
                Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.
                Athens, after a tyranny in the second half of the 6th century, established ancient Europe's first democracy as 
                a radical solution to prevent the aristocracy from regaining power. A citizens' assembly (the Ecclesia), for the
                discussion of city policy, had existed since the reforms of Draco; all citizens were permitted to attend after 
                the reforms of Solon, but the poorest citizens could not address the assembly or run for office. With the 
                establishment of the democracy, the assembly became the de jure mechanism of government; all citizens had equal 
                rivileges in the assembly. However, non-citizens, foreigners living in Athens, slaves and women had no political 
                rights at all. After the rise of the democracy in Athens, other city-states founded democracies. However, many 
                retained more traditional forms of government. As so often in other matters, Sparta was a notable exception to the 
                rest of Greece, ruled through the whole period by not one, but two hereditary monarchs. This was a form of diarchy.
                
                <div class="container mt-3">
                    <h4 class="text-center mb-3">Athens:</h4>
                    Ancient Athens was inhabited around 3,000 years ago. Athens has one of the longest histories of any city in 
                    Europe and in the world. It became the leading city of Ancient Greece in the first millennium BC. Its cultural 
                    achievements during the 5th century BC laid the foundations of western civilization. During the Middle Ages, 
                    Athens experienced decline and then a recovery under the Byzantine Empire. Athens was relatively prosperous 
                    during the Crusades, benefiting from medieval Italian trade.Fifth-century Athens refers to the Greek city-state 
                    Athens in the period of roughly 480 BC-404 BC. This was a period of Athenian political hegemony, economic growth 
                    and cultural flourishing known as the Golden Age of Athens or Age of Pericles. The period began in 480 BC when an 
                    Athenian-led coalition of city-states, known as the Delian League, defeated the Persians at Salamis. As the fifth 
                    century wore on, what started as an alliance of independent city-states gradually became an Athenian empire. 
                    Eventually, Athens abandoned the pretense of parity among its allies and relocated the Delian League treasury 
                    from Delos to Athens, where it funded the building of the Athenian Acropolis. With its enemies under its feet 
                    nd its political fortunes guided by legendary statesman and orator Pericles, Athens as a center of literature, 
                    philosophy (see Greek philosophy) and the arts (see Greek theatre). Some of the most important figures of Western 
                    cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists Aeschylus, Aristophanes, 
                    Euripides and Sophocles, the philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Socrates.

                    <h4 class="mt-3 text-center mb-3">Sparta:</h4>
                    Sparta was a Dorian Greek military state, originally centered in Laconia. As a city-state devoted to military 
                    training, Sparta possessed the most formidable army in the Greek world, and after achieving notable victories 
                    over the Athenian and Persian Empires, regarded itself as the natural protector of Greece. Laconia or 
                    Lacedaemon (Λακεδαίμων) was the name of the wider city-state centered at the city of Sparta, though the name 
                    "Sparta" is now used for both.
                    Following the victories in the Messenian Wars (631 BC), Sparta's reputation as a land-fighting force was unequaled.
                    In 480 BC a small Spartan unit under King Leonidas made a legendary last stand against a massive, invading Persian army at 
                    the Battle of Thermopylae. One year later, Sparta assembled at full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians 
                    at Plataea. There, a decisive Greek victory put an end to the Greco-Persian War along with Persian ambition of expanding 
                    into Europe. Even though this war was won by a pan-Hellenic army, credit was given to Sparta, who, besides being the 
                    protagonist at Thermopylae and Plataea, had been the nominal leader of the entire Greek expedition.
                    In later Classical times, Sparta along with Athens, Thebes and Persia had been the main regional powers fighting 
                    for supremacy against each other. As a result of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, a traditionally continental 
                    culture, became a naval power. At the peak of her power, she subdued many of the key Greek states and even managed 
                    to overpower the powerful Athenian navy. By the end of the 5th century, she stood out as a state which had defeated 
                    are both the Persian and Athenian Empires, a period which marks the Spartan Hegemony.Sparta was, above all, a 
                    militarist state, and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth.

                Macedonia was the name of an ancient kingdom in the northernmost part of ancient Greece, bordering Epirus to the 
                west and the ancient thracian Odrysian kingdom to the east. For a brief period it became the most powerful state 
                in the world after Alexander the Great conquered most of the known world, including the entire Achaemenid Empire, 
                inaugurating the Hellenistic period of Greek history.The rise of Macedon, from a small kingdom at the periphery of 
                Classical Greek affairs, to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred in the space 
                of just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of 
                Philip II of Macedon. Philip's military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonian greatness brought him early success. 
                He had however first to re-establish a situation which had been greatly worsened by the defeat against the Illyrians in 
                which King Perdiccas himself had died. The Paionians and the Thracians had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of the 
                country, while the Athenians had landed, at Methoni on the coast, a contingent under a Macedonian pretender called Argeus. 
                Using diplomacy, Philip pushed back Paionians and Thracians promising tributes, and crushed the 3,000 Athenian hoplites (359). 
                Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army. His most 
                important innovation was doubtless the introduction of the phalanx infantry corps, armed with the famous sarissa, an exceedingly 
                long spear, at the time the most important army corps in Macedonia.Philip's son, Alexander the Great, managed to briefly 
                extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states, but also to the Persian empire, including Egypt and lands 
                as far east as the fringes of India. Alexander's adoption of the styles of government of the conquered territories was 
                accompanied by the spread of Greek culture and learning through his vast empire. Although the empire fractured into multiple 
                Hellenic regimes shortly after his death, his conquests left a lasting legacy, not least in the new Greek-speaking cities 
                founded across Persia's western territories, heralding the Hellenistic period. In the partition of Alexander's empire among 
                the Diadochi, Macedonia fell to the Antipatrid dynasty, which was overthrown by the Antigonid dynasty after only a few years.

                the wars of the Diadochi between his generals (the Diadochi, or 'Successors'), which lasted for forty years before a 
                more-or-less stable arrangement was established, consisting of four major domains:

                A further two kingdoms later emerged, the so-called Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdom. Hellenistic culture 
                thrived in its preservation of the past. The states of the Hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past 
                and its seemingly lost glories. Athens retained its position as the most prestigious seat of higher education, 
                especially in the domains of philosophy and rhetoric, with considerable libraries. Alexandria was a center of Greek 
                learning and the Library of Alexandria had 700,000 volumes. The city of Pergamon became a major center of book 
                production, possessing a library of some 200,000 volumes, second only to Alexandria's. The island of Rhodes boasted 
                a famous finishing school for politics and diplomacy. Antioch was founded as a metropolis and center of Greek 
                learning which retained its status into the era of Christianity. Seleucia replaced Babylon as the metropolis of the 
                lower Tigris.

                The Odrysian Kingdom proper was a Thracian kingdom that existed from the early 5th century BC at least until the 
                mid-3rd century BC. It consisted mainly of present-day Bulgaria and parts of Southeastern Romania (Northern Dobruja), 
                Northern Greece and European Turkey. Dominated by the eponymous Odrysian people, it was the largest and most powerful 
                Thracian realm and the first larger political entity of the eastern Balkans. Before the foundation of Seuthopolis in the 
                late 4th century it had no fixed capital.The Odrysian kingdom was founded by king Teres I, exploiting the collapse 
                of the Persian presence in Europe due to failed invasion of Greece in 480-79. Teres and his son Sitalces pursued a 
                policy of expansion, making the kingdom one of the most powerful of its time. Throughout much of its early history 
                it remained an ally of Athens and even joined the Peloponnesian War on its side. By 400 the state showed first signs 
                of fatigue, although the skilled Cotys I initiated a brief renaissance that lasted until his murder in 360.
                The Getae, a northern Thracian people located between the northeastern foothills of the Haemus range 
                and the lower Danube and the Black Sea, had been part of the Odrysian realm since Teres I, even though it is not 
                clear how tightly they were actually incorporated into the state. When and how the Getae became independent is not 
                discussed in the available sources. Perhaps they became independent during the rule of Cotys I or after his 
                death in 360. Rich funeral treasures from the second half of the 4th century, like those of Agighiol, Peretu or 
                Borovo, attest to the increasing wealth of the Getic elite. Several artefacts seem to have originated in the 
                Odrysian kingdom and may well have been prestige gifts.By the middle of the 4th century there existed a Getic 
                kingdom that was to thrive for a century.The Getic capital was Helis, which has been identified with the 
                archaeological site of Sboryanovo, which was founded in the 330s or early 320s and housed around 10.000 
                inhabitants. It seems that the Getae also became active in Muntenia north of the Danube,a region that 
                would come to constitute a part of the "Dacia" of imperial Roman historiography. The first Getic king to appear 
                in the sources was Cothelas, who married his daughter Meda to Philip II, thus concluding an alliance between the 
                two states.This probably happened during or shortly after Philip's conquest of the Odrysians. The kingdom 
                survived two wars with Lysimachus and the Celtic invasion in around 280, but eventually disintegrated a few decades later.
                 Helis/Sboryanovo was completely destroyed by an earthquake in the middle of the 3rd century.
                With Alexander's absence in Asia, the Strategoi of Thrace engaged in rebellions and failed expeditions against the 
                Getae, greatly unsettling the country in the process.At the end of the 330s or in the mid-320s (the dating is 
                not entirely clear), a certain Seuthes, later known as Seuthes III, instigated a Thracian rebellion.He seems to 
                have been an Odrysian and may have been associated with the royal house of Cersebleptes, although his social 
                background must remain speculation.Seuthes' goal seems to have been the revival of an independent Odrysian 
                state.Seuthes ruled in the interior, what is Thrace north of the Rhodopes, but not the coastal regions of the 
                Aegean and Black Sea.Probably after the death of Alexander in 323, he founded the capital town of Seuthopolis, 
                on the Tonzos river, near modern Kazanlak, and named after himself.The Dacian Kingdom reached its 
                greatest territorial extent under Burebista's rule (82BC-44BC). During his rule, he conquered territories from 
                Central Europe to the Balkans, reaching the Aegean sea. He is well known by the Greek scholars as the "Celtic Slayer", 
                because he defeated and killed many Celtic tribes from the Balkans (Scordisci) and the Central Europe (Boii & Taurisci).
                In 48BC Burebista tried to influence the Roman politics, during the Roman civil war by allying with Pompey Magnus 
                against the victorious Julius Caesar. But Pompey was defeated and later killed in Ptolemaic Egypt. After all of that, 
                Julius Caesar viewed Burebista's Empire as a threat and he planned to invade it alongside with the Parthian Empire. 
                But he was assassinated in 44 BC. Burebista's state collapsed into various kingdoms. It will never be unified until 
                Decebalus becomes the last King in 87AD.The Thoracian kingdom, also known as the Sapaean kingdom, was the 
                continuation of the Thracian state from the middle of the 1st century BC to 46 AD. It was dominated by the 
                Sapaean tribe, who ruled from their capital Bizye in what is now northwestern Turkey. Initially only of limited 
                relevance, its power grew significantly after the battle of Actium in 31 BC, when Emperor Augustus installed a new 
                dynasty that proved to be highly loyal and expansive. Conquering and ruling much of Thrace on Roman behalf, it 
                lasted until 46 AD, when Emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom and made Thrace a Roman province.

                    Ancient Rome is widely known as ancient Europe's largest and most powerful civilization. After the Punic 
                    Wars Rome was already one of the biggest empires on the planet but its expansion continued with the invasions 
                    of Greece and Asia Minor. By 27 BC Rome had control over half of Europe as well as Northern Africa and large 
                    amounts of the Middle East. Rome also had a developed culture, building on the earlier Greek culture. From the 
                    time of Augustus to the Fall of the Western Empire, Rome dominated Western Eurasia, comprising the majority of 
                    its population.Roman expansion began long before the state was changed into an Empire and reached its zenith 
                    under emperor Trajan with the conquest of Mesopotamia and Armenia in AD 113. The period of the 
                    "Five Good Emperors" saw a successions of peaceful years and the Empire was prosperous. Each emperor of this 
                    period was adopted by his predecessor. The Nerva–Antonine dynasty was a dynasty of seven consecutive Roman 
                    Emperors who ruled over the Roman Empire from 96 to 192. These Emperors are Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus 
                    Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, and Commodus.

                The Seleucid Empire was a Hellenistic empire, and the eastern remnant of the former Achaemenid Persian Empire 
                following its breakup after Alexander the Great's invasion. The Seleucid Empire was centered in the near East. 
                It was a center of Hellenistic culture which maintained the Greek customs and Greek-speaking Macedonian elite.
                Seleucid expansion into Greece was abruptly halted after decisive defeats at the hands of the Roman army. 
                Much of the eastern part of the empire was conquered by the Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia in the 
                mid-2nd century BC, yet the Seleucid kings continued to rule a rump state from Syria until the invasion by 
                Armenian king Tigranes the Great and their ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey.

                The Ptolemaic dynasty, sometimes also known as the Lagids, was a Greek royal family which ruled 
                the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt during the Hellenistic period.Ptolemy, one of the seven somatophylakes (bodyguards)
                who served as Alexander the Great's generals and deputies, was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander's death 
                in 323 BC. In 305 BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy I, later known as "Soter" (saviour). The Egyptians soon 
                accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt. Ptolemy's family ruled Egypt until 
                the Roman conquest of 30 BC. All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name Ptolemy.Ptolemaic Egypt began 
                when Ptolemy I Soter declared himself Pharaoh of Egypt in 305 BC and ended with the death of queen Cleopatra 
                VII of Egypt and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending 
                from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became 
                the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, 
                they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had 
                themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life. 
                Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest. The Ptolemies faced rebellions of 
                native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the 
                decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome.
